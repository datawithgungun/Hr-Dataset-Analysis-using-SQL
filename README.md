# HR Data Analysis Using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an HR dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights related to employee demographics, job roles, performance, attrition, and salary trends. The aim is to support data-driven decision-making in HR processes like hiring, retention, and workforce planning.

## 🧠 Objective

* Identify attrition trends and factors
* Analyze salary distributions and job satisfaction
* Understand demographic impacts on performance
* Segment data by departments and job roles

## 📂 Dataset Details

* **File Name**: `HR Dataset.xlsx`
* **Total Records**: Varies by sheet
* **Key Columns**:

  * `EmployeeID`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Department`, `JobRole`
  * `MonthlyIncome`, `PerformanceRating`, `JobSatisfaction`
  * `Attrition`, `EducationField`, `YearsAtCompany`, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL**: For querying and data analysis
* **MySQL / PostgreSQL** *(depending on your actual setup)*

## 🔍 Key SQL Queries/Analysis Performed

* Attrition count by gender and department
* Average salary by job role
* Performance vs satisfaction comparison
* Correlation between education and income
* Years at company vs attrition rate

## 📈 Sample Insights

* **Sales Executive** role had the highest attrition.
* Employees aged 30–40 showed better retention.
* Higher job satisfaction correlates with lower attrition.

## 🧾 How to Run

1. Import the dataset into your SQL environment (after converting to `.csv` if needed).
2. Run the SQL queries from the `queries.sql` file or copy-paste from your SQL editor.
3. Analyze the results directly or export to Excel/Power BI for visualization.
